# PitMod Forge 1.8.9
A generic mod for The Pit. This mod was made for screwing around with minor things. If you want to use it, go ahead, but be aware that it isn't a very complete mod and it  will likely not receive many updates.
## (!) Notice
Some of the features of this mod are **NOT** allowed. Use at your own risk.
## Features
- SewerFinder: Shows treasure location in the sewer.
- That's literally it. This is the sole thing that compelled me to make this mod.
## Disclaimer
I technically didn't test this on Hypixel, the map rotated before I could make it and I would **never** cheat on Hypixel!
## Commands
<font size="1">these are literally just debug commands. im not removing them in prod, cry about it. this mod isn't really made for prod anyway, it's just me screwing around and I figured I'd upload it because I can.</font>
- `/pmforceinit` - Forces the mod to initialize or deinitialize.
- `/pmsewerchest <start/end>` - Simulates sewer chest spawning or being looted. Can also be used to rescan.
## Installation
